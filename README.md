# Urban-Mobility-Reinforcement-Learning-Problem

This repository contains a solution for the qualification project for candidates for PhD students in COeXISTENCE. The project focuses on developing an intelligent system capable of optimizing urban mobility using reinforcement learning techniques.


## Project Structure
The main components of the project are as follows:

* **functions.py**: This Python file contains the implementation of the classes used in the project. It includes the necessary functions and methods for defining the problem, setting up the environment, and implementing reinforcement learning algorithms.
* **UrbanMobilityRL.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the runs these classes and presents various graphs and visualizations related to the problem.
